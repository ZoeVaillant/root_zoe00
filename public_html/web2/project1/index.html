          <h2>Dance</h2>
          <p>
            I really enjoy dancing, specifically Hip Hop. Before doing Hip Hop
            dance I did more technical styles like lyrical, contemporary and
            ballet. In the last 2 years I had the privilege to be on two
            different Hip Hop teams called Unleashed and Ellematic at my dance
            studio, H4L. On these teams, I competed at dance competitions! Last
            year, when I was on Ellematic, we made a small trip to New York to
            take some dance classes, and we put on our own show called "Growing Pains"! I think dance
            is really fun, and is such a creative and healthy form of exercise.
            I always have a really good time when I'm dancing with my friends at my
            studio!:)

          <h2>Painting</h2>
          <p>
            I really enjoy painting because it is calming and very fun! I took
            art in high school, and I made a few paintings in those classes. During my art class
            in grade 10, I made a painting of a picture my mom took on a hiking
            trail. The assignment was to make a painting while trying to
            incorporate the style of one of the painters from "The Group of
            Seven". In grade 11, we had to re-create an impressionist painting,
            and I decided to re-create Claude Monet's famous “The Water Lily
            Pond” painting. For these two paintings, I fist drew on the canvas
            and then painted. I also recently made a painting for my Dad as a
            birthday present, of a scene from the Studio Ghibli film “Porco
            Rosso”, which I first traced and then painted. Overall, painting is
            a hobby of mine that I really enjoy, but I don’t do it very often. However
            when I get the chance to, I always have a great time!

          <h2>Wood Working</h2>
          <p>
            I was first introduced to woodworking/wood burning in high school.
            It was an elective class I was able to take and I enjoyed the class
            very much! I took it once in grade 9 and then a second time in grade
            11. We did a bunch of wood burning, some carving, and a lot of
            sanding. Before we burned anything onto the wood, we would take a
            printed image that we chose, and would trace it on a piece of carbon paper that was placed
            onto the piece of wood. When we took both the papers off the piece, we were left with
            the image transferred onto the wood as a guide for when we started the
            burning process. To wood burn, we used this tool that looked like a
            very large pen with a tip that was switchable. The tip heats up
            to a high temperature and when you draw with it on a peice of wood,
            it burns the wood! I really enjoyed making these pieces and I would
            recomend this activity to anyone whose interested in trying it out!
