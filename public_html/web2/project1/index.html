          <h2>Dance</h2>
          <p>I really enjoy dancing, specifically hip hop. Before doing hip hop dance I did more technical styles like lyrical/contemporary/ballet. Two years ago I was on a great and fun team called “Unleashed” where we competed a choreography we had been working on 3 times. Last year I was on a competitive dance team called “Ellematic” and It was such a great and unique experience. We had competed a choreography we had been working on and performed our own show which was around 30mins long in June of last year. I find dance is  really great and is such a fun a healthy form of an escape from everyday life.</p>

          <h2>Painting</h2>
          <p>I really enjoy painting as it is really calming and creative. I took art in high school, and we had made some paintings. In grade 10 I made a painting of a picture my mom took on a hiking trail, while trying to incorporate the style of one of the painters from The Group of Seven. In grade 11, we had to recreate an impressionist painting, and I decided to recreate the famous “The Water Lily Pond” made my Claude Monet. I also recently made a painting for my Dad as a birthday present, of a scene from the Studio Ghibli film “Porco Rosso” (it’s one of my dads favorites). Overall, I enjoy painting for fun as it is a hobby of mine, however I don’t do it very often. But, when I do paint, I always have a great time!</p>
