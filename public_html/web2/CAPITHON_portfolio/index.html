                <h3>Project description</h3>
                <p>During the Capithon week, my team and I created a board game that encourages connection making and experience sharing! We had goals and focuses to meet and to incorperate into our project.</p>

                <p>Goals:
                    Empathy, and supporting the holistic well-being of students
                </p>

                <p>
                    Focuses:
                    Encourage group activities outside classrooms, Promote opportunities for social connection, create safe space for engaging in sensitive convos, create opportunities to contact with nature and promote wellness activities.

                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p>One of the challenges we faced was deciding whether we wanted a six sided die. We didn't know if we wanted our game to use a die with a maximum number of six, since if a player were to roll a high number, they would be going uo the game board too quickly.</p>                                                                   
            </section>
        
            <section id="solu">
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>Our solution to this problem was to create our own die! Instead of using a regular die, we decided to have one that would only have a maximun number of 3 to possibly roll. This way, the game will now last longer.</p>

                <p>I made a small notion page to keep track of basically eveything that was going on in the project.</p>
                <p>I put down the names of all our team members, a calendar where we put down our meeting dates, a page with our project description, a to-do list,our figma board, and the cpithon GitHub page.</p>

                    final touches and just refined it a little bit.</p>

        <h2>Capyskill</h2>
        <section class="capi">
            <p>For this project, the Capikill I chose to try to focus on was VA.1.4, Refine and Improve my work. Before I started the project, I think I was around a level 7 (between levels 6 and 8).</p>
            <section>
                <h4>Reasoning</h4>
                <p>I think I could start to actively searching for these design principals or consciously go through each principal to see if I’ve included the ones that are most important. I take the time to analyze, make changes and produce work I am happy with, however I can always improve. I make sure that my work follows the guidelines and rules given for the specific project. I can give feedback to my friends and classmates as well as receive feedback on my work. I think I already try to put meaning and purpose to my designs, however I could always improve.</p>

            <section>
                <h4>Application</h4>
                <p>I think I was able to refine my part of the project, as well as the Figma board. My first version of the game piece didn’t look really great, so I made an adjustment to the size of the flag which made it ever better. I also did some final touches on the Figma board. </p>

            <section>
                <h4>Present Level</h4>
                <p>I think I am basically at a level 7.5 or maybe even 8</p>
